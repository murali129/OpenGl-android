http://developer.android.com/training/graphics/opengl provides how to draw the basic triangle and rotate. 

Its really hard to simulate rigid body properties or create animations using these basic units, the basic idea of this project is to build a game engine using OPENGL wrapper which is lite weight and faster than game engines such as Unity
